# 1. Allow connections from the Docker network for the order-service
# The 0.0.0.0/0 allows connections from any source, which is common in a
# Docker Compose network for development environments. Use 'md5' for password authentication.
host    all   postgres        0.0.0.0/0               md5

# 2. Keep the default local connection rules (usually required for psql and internal tools)
local   all             all                                     trust

# Optional: You may want to allow other services access to all databases (less secure, but useful for initial dev)
